# quadratic

Python program that solves quadratic equations and gives the answers in terms of radicals.

The program gives the solutions as algebraic answers rather than decimals. Square roots are represented by radical signs and fractions are simplified and represented in lowest terms. The program also deals with complex solutions and represents âˆš-1 as i.
